# Golub - Smart Email Relay Service

Golub is a lightweight email relay service built with .NET 9. It intelligently rotates between multiple email providers (such as SendGrid, Brevo, and others) to maximize free-tier email sending before switching to the next available provider.

## Features

- **Smart Provider Rotation** ‚Äì Uses free-tier quotas before switching to another provider.
- **API Key Management** ‚Äì API keys are securely stored in a database.
- **Configurable Rate Limiting** ‚Äì Sending limits are dynamically adjusted based on available provider quotas.
- **Self-Hosted** ‚Äì Runs on Linux (Ubuntu) or any environment that supports .NET 9.
- **Open-Source Contributions** ‚Äì Fork, improve, and submit PRs!

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- PostgreSQL or any supported database for storing API keys and provider settings
- Linux server (for deployment) or Windows/Mac for local development

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golub.git
   cd golub
   ```
2. Configure your database connection in `appsettings.json`:

## Configuration
- **Email Providers:** Settings are stored in the database but service-level configurations remain in `appsettings.json`.
- **Rate Limits:** The service dynamically adjusts based on available quotas for each provider.

## Deployment (Ubuntu Linux)

1. Publish the application:
   ```sh
   dotnet publish -c Release -o out
   ```
2. Move to your server and run:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/out
   dotnet Golub.dll
   ```

For a production-ready setup, consider running Golub as a **systemd service** or inside a **Docker container**.
